#Ghost: The Spooktacular Compression Algorithm üëª

Welcome to Ghost, the eeriest compression algorithm you'll ever encounter! Ghost works its spectral magic by finding sequences that aren't there and using them to substitute larger sequences. It's a phantom in the binary night, reducing file sizes with spooky efficiency.

##How It Works üéÉ

    Extraction: Ghost prowls your data, extracting all possible subsequences and counting their occurrences.
    Filtering: Only the subsequences that occur more than once survive the spectral filter.
    Finding the Missing: Ghost hunts for sequences that are missing from the data, lurking in the shadows of potential patterns.
    Replacement: The most common sequences are replaced by these ghostly missing sequences, creating compressed data that fits in the haunted .boo extension.

##The .boo Extension üëª

When Ghost haunts your files, it compresses them into a .boo file, carrying the essence of your original data in a spooky, compact form. Don't be afraid to open it‚Äîit's just smaller!

##Installation üï∏Ô∏è

Clone this repository to your local lair:

bash

git clone https://github.com/RAZZULLIX/ghost.git
cd ghost-compression

Make sure you have Python installed, or Ghost might get cranky.
Usage ü¶á

Run Ghost from the command line with:

bash

python ghost-compress.py <file_path> <iterations> <max_length>

    <file_path>: Path to the file you wish to compress. (It helps if it's already creepy!)
    <iterations>: Number of iterations for the ghostly compression cycle. Use -1 for endless haunting.
    <max_length>: The maximum length of sequences Ghost should consider in its eerie evaluations. (Beware of high numbers or your memory will be cursed!)

Example:

bash

python ghost-compress.py myfile.txt 100 256
